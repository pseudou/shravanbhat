I am driven by a passion for creating software that enhances people's lives. I also have a strong inclination towards sharing knowledge, as I believe in the power of mentoring and helping others grow!

Currently, I'm working at PayPal as a backend engineer. I also have research experience in applying deep learning and machine learning alogrithms to medical applications and IoT.

I hope this space will allow you to become more familiar with my work and experiences, which have greatly influenced my personal and professional development.
