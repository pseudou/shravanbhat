I am passionate about creating scalable, efficient software that addresses real-world challenges and enhances daily life. Alongside my technical pursuits, I strongly believe in sharing knowledge and mentoring, as these are essential to fostering growth and collaboration within teams and communities.

Currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at Texas A&M University, I bring over three years of experience as a backend engineer at PayPal, where I specialized in cloud infrastructure and distributed systems. My research spans applying graph mining algorithms to memory-disaggregated environments and leveraging deep learning techniques in biomedical and IoT applications.

This space reflects my journey of blending research and industry experiences, shaping both my personal and professional growth. Feel free to explore to know more about my work and aspirations!
