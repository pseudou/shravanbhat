I am a math enthusiast, problem solver, and a software engineer. Currently, I work as a backend engineer at PayPal, focusing on the product COPTR. I collaborate with various teams and leaders to create a platform that allows data scientists and analysts to interact with GCP products like BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Dataproc and providing valuable insights on cloud application usage and associated costs. One area that has captured my attention is the programming language Golang and its capabilities in the context of cloud computing. I find great excitement in delving deeper into this subject and discovering new ways to leverage Golang for cloud-based solutions.

Beyond my professional work, I have a keen interest in exploring the practical applications of deep learning. During my undergraduate studies, I developed a strong foundation in applied mathematics, which has allowed me to delve into subjects related to this field. With a focus on deep learning and machine learning algorithms, I have been intrigued by their potential applications in areas such as medical settings, IoT, and signal and image processing. I am eager to further expand my knowledge and contribute to these fields through continued learning and exploration.

Throughout my professional career and undergraduate studies, I have consistently demonstrated a commitment to excellence. I excelled in subjects aligned with my interests and received recognition for my achievements. Additionally, I actively participate in hackathons, including winning second place in "Imagineer". Furthermore, I am currently working on publishing a research paper in the esteemed Elsevier journal, Expert Systems With Applications.

In addition to my software engineering and applied mathematics research interests, I am dedicated to sharing my knowledge and expertise with others. I have actively mentored underprivileged junior college students in mathematics and computer basics through a non-profit NGO called "Make A Difference." These experiences have not only developed my communication and leadership skills but have also inspired me to support and guide the next generation.
