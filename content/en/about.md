I am a math enthusiast, problem solver, and software engineer with a passion for tackling challenging problems through innovative solutions. Previously, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at PayPal, where I contributed to multiple backend services, including the Cloud Showback Service and COPTR. My work involved creating platforms to help data scientists and analysts interact with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services like BigQuery, Cloud Storage, and Dataproc. These projects provided valuable insights into cloud application usage and associated costs, boosting team efficiency and cost transparency.

One area that fascinates me is the programming language Golang and its role in cloud computing. I’ve explored its capabilities extensively, optimizing cloud-based services for scalability and performance. Projects like the Tableau Go SDK and Llama, a Spark application crawler, reflect my expertise in leveraging cutting-edge tools for backend development and distributed systems.

In addition to my professional work, I am deeply invested in research. Currently, as a Research Assistant at Texas A&M University, I focus on graph mining algorithms for memory-disaggregated environments and memory optimization for Golang applications. During my undergraduate studies, I applied deep learning techniques to biomedical signal processing, developing a CNN model for eye-movement-based wheelchair control for quadriplegic patients, achieving 92% accuracy. This foundation has fueled my ongoing interest in deep learning, IoT, and their practical applications.

I am proud to have participated in hackathons, such as the Tidal Hackathon, where my team secured second place for our LoreBubbl app, an innovative eReader that provides contextual insights for books and research papers. Beyond professional and research endeavors, I am dedicated to mentorship. I have guided underprivileged junior college students in mathematics and computer basics through the NGO "Make A Difference," an experience that enriched my communication and leadership skills.

Currently, I am pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science at Texas A&M University, focusing on systems, memory disaggregation, and graph mining. My journey continues to be driven by a desire to merge research, practical applications, and mentorship to make meaningful contributions to my fields of interest.
